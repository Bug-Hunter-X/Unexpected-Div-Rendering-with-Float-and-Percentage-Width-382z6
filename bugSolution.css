The solution uses flexbox for reliable layout:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  box-sizing: border-box; /* Ensures padding and border are included in the width calculation */
  flex: 1 0 50%; /* Ensures each div takes up 50% width, but is also flexible */
}
.container {
  display: flex;
}
```

This approach avoids the inconsistencies associated with floating elements and percentage widths, providing a more predictable and consistent layout across various browsers.
